            The religion of the ancestors of the Garos is Songsarek. Their tradition "Dakbewal" relates
             to their most prominent cultural activities. In 2000, the group called "Rishi Jilma" was 
             founded to safeguard the ancient Garo Songsarek religion. Seeing the Songsarek population 
             in decline, youth from the Dadenggiri subdivision of Garo Hills felt the need to preserve 
             the Songsarek culture. The Rishi Jilma group is active in about 480 villages in and around 
             Garo Hills.
             The Garos, who call themselves A chiks, are the second largest tribe in Meghalaya. As such they are the dominant tribe and inhabit the greater parts of the present Ampati Civil Sub-Division.
             The Garos have a strong tradition that they have come from Tibet. According to their legend, 
             the ancestors of Garo inhabited a province of Tibet named Torus, where without any apparent 
             reason they started on a voyage of discovery under the leadership of two chiefs Jappa-Jalima 
             and Sukpa-Bongipa.

      Though the origins of the Khasis remained obscure, scholars have however agreed that they were the 
      earliest people to have settled in North East India. They broke fom the main branch of the Austro 
      Asiatic people around 60,000 years ago and arrived at their present location about 56,000 years ago 
      much before the arrival of the larger Tibeto-Burman groups which formed many modern tribal communities
       in the North East today, which means that the Khasis were a Neolithic people. Evidence of Neolithic 
       tools dating to as late as 1st century BC were found on the ridges of U Lum Sohpetbneng peak, a sacred
        peak where the Khasis claimed to have descended from. Studies have also shown that the Khasi 
        started to smelt iron as far back as 2000 years ago, with the oldest Iron slag found dating back
         to 80 years before the start of the present era.
